## 🚀 Project Overview

**Cognitive KCS Analyzer** is a domain-specific analytical tool built to **enhance the quality and effectiveness of knowledge base (KB) articles** in a support ecosystem.

Unlike generic summarization tools, this solution focuses on:
- 🔍 Evaluating KB article quality using LLM intelligence.
- 🧩 Identifying **gaps** in the knowledge base by comparing it against new customer queries.
- ✍️ Suggesting **targeted improvements** to ensure articles are actionable, complete, and well-structured.

---

## 🎯 Why This Project?

### 🧠 For Data Analysts:
- Analyze support ticket streams & article metrics.
- Generate **quality scores** and **gap detection insights**.
- (Optionally) Visualize performance with Streamlit charts.

### 💻 For Software Developers:
- Build scalable backend logic in Python.
- Integrate with the OpenAI API (or alternatives).
- Design structured workflows for analysis and improvement suggestions.
